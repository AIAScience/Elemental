NOTE: This list is new will hopefully grow rapidly. I would like to move towards
      making Elemental (and my other open source efforts) closer to 
      publications.

[1] Paolo Bientinesi, Brian Gunter, and Robert A. van de Geijn, "Families of 
    algorithms related to the inversion of a Symmetric Positive Definite 
    matrix", ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, Vol. 35, Issue 1, 
    pp. 3:1--3:22, 2008.

    NOTE: The variant 2 single-sweep algorithm from Fig. 9 was parallelized for
          Elemental's HPD inversion.

[2] Peter A. Businger and Gene H. Golub, "Linear least squares solutions by 
    Householder transformations", Numerische Mathematik, Vol. 7, pp. 269--276,
    1965.

    NOTE: This paper introduced the Businger-Golub algorithm for column-pivoted
          QR decompositions.

[3] Emmanuel J. Candes and Benjamin Recht, "Exact matrix completion via convex 
    optimization", Foundations of Computational Mathematics, Vol. 9, Issue 6, 
    pp. 717--772, 2009.

    NOTE: This paper is used for the definition of the coherence of a subspace
          with respect to the standard unit basis vectors.

[4] Tony F. Chan, "An improved algorithm for computing the Singular Value
    Decomposition", ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, Vol. 8, Issue 1, 
    pp. 72--83, 1982.
    http://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~lekheng/courses/324/chan.pdf

    NOTE: This paper introduced the idea of using a QR decomposition as a first
          step in the SVD of a non-square matrix in order to accelerate the 
          computation.

[5] Zlatko Drmac and Zvonimir Bujanovic, "On the failure of rank revealing QR
    factorization software -- a case study", LAPACK Working Note 176, 2006.

    NOTE: Elemental uses the same norm updating strategy as this paper and the
          corresponding LAPACK implementation of dgeqpf.f

[6] Gene H. Golub, Virginia Klema, and G. W. Stewart, "Rank degeneracy and least
    squares problems", Tech. Report STAN-CS-76-559, Computer Science Department,
    Stanford University, 1976.
    ftp://reports.stanford.edu/pub/cstr/reports/cs/tr/76/559/CS-TR-76-559.pdf

    NOTE: Introduced GKS matrix, which the greedy RRQR fails on.

[7] Gene H. Golub and Christian Reinsch, "Singular value decomposition and 
    least squares solutions", Numerische Mathematik, Vol. 14, No. 5, 
    pp. 403--420, 1970.

    NOTE: This paper introduced the standard algorithm for computing the SVD.

[8] Gene H. Golub and Charles F. van Loan, "Matrix Computations", 3rd edition,
    Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1996.

    NOTE: Added for definition of Kahan matrix (pg. 260)

[9] Ming Gu and Stanley Eisenstat, "Efficient algorithms for computing a strong
    rank-revealing QR factorization", SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 
    Vol. 17, Issue 4, pp. 848--869, 1996.

    NOTE: Standard reference for (strong) RRQR factorizations, which will 
          hopefully be added to Elemental in the near future.

[10] Bruce Hendrickson, Elizabeth Jessup, and Christopher Smith, "Towards an
     efficient parallel eigensolver for dense symmetric matrices", SIAM Journal
     on Scientific Computing, Vol. 20, Issue 3, pp. 1132--1154, 1999.

     NOTE: One of the origins for the square-grid tridiagonalization algorithm 
           used in Elemental (which was later refined by Stanley et al.).

[11] Zhongxiao Jia, "Using cross-product matrices to compute the SVD",
     Numerical Algorithms, 42:31--61, 2006.
     http://faculty.math.tsinghua.edu.cn/~zjia/jianumalgo.pdf

     NOTE: This could serve as a foundation for achieving high absolute accuracy
           in a cross-product based algorithm for computing the SVD. Such an
           approach should be more scalable than the current 
           bidiagonalization-based approach.

     performance parallel eigensolver to electronic structure calculation", 
     In Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing, IEEE 
     Computer Society, 1998.

     NOTE: Contains the main algorithm used for Elemental's two-sided triangular
           solves.

[13] Ken Stanley, "Execution time of symmetric eigensolvers", Ph.D. Thesis,
     University of California at Berkeley, 1997.

     NOTE: Contains the algorithm used for Elemental's square-grid 
           tridiagonalization.
