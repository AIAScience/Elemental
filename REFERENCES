NOTE: This list of references will hopefully grow very soon. I would like to
      move towards making Elemental (and all of my open source efforts) closer
      to a publication.

    Decomposition", ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, Vol. 8, No. 1, 
    pp. 72--83, 1982.

    NOTE: This paper introduced the idea of using a QR decomposition as a first
          step in the SVD of a non-square matrix in order to accelerate the 
          computation.

    least squares solutions", Numerische Mathematik, Vol. 14, No. 5, 
    pp. 403--420, 1970.

    NOTE: This paper introduced the standard algorithm for computing the SVD.

    Numerical Algorithms, 42:31--61, 2006.

    NOTE: This paper could serve as a foundation for achieving high absolute
          accuracy in a cross-product based algorithm for computing the SVD.
          Such an approach should be more scalable than the current 
          bidiagonalization-based approach.
