NOTE: This list is new will hopefully grow rapidly. I would like to move towards
      making Elemental (and my other open source efforts) closer to 
      publications.


Spectral Divide and Conquer
===========================

Elemental contains preliminary implementations of spectral divide and conquer
algorithms derived from the following paper:
@article{
  author={Z. Bai and J. Demmel and J. Dongarra and A. Petitet and H. Robinson
          and K. Stanley},
  title={The spectral decomposition of nonsymmetric matrices on distributed
         memory parallel computers},
  journal={SIAM J. Sci. Comput},
  volume=18,
  number=5,
  pages={1446--1461}, 
  year=1997,
}

The randomized approach from the following paper is used in order to avoid a
pivoted QR decomposition:
@article{
  author={J. Demmel and I. Dumitriu and O. Holtz},
  title={Fast linear algebra is stable},
  journal={Numerische Mathematik},
  volume=108,
  number=1,
  pages={59--91},
  year=2007
}

TODO: Add later Ballard et al. paper

Pivoted QR
==========

This paper introduced the Businger-Golub algorithm for column-pivoted QR
decompositions.
@article{
  author={P.A. Businger and G.H. Golub},
  title={Linear least squares solutions by {H}ouseholder transformations},
  journal={Numerische Mathematik},
  volume=7,
  number=3,
  pages={269--276},
  year=1965
}

Elemental uses the same norm updating strategy as this paper and the 
corresponding LAPACK implementation of dgeqpf.f
@article{
  author={Z. Drmac and Z. Bujanovic},
  title={On the failure of {R}ank-{R}evealing {QR} factorization software --
         a case study},
  journal={ACM Trans. Math. Soft},
  volume=35,
  number=2,
  pages={12:1--12:28},
  year=2008
}

Introduced GKS matrix, which the greedy RRQR fails on.
@techreport{
  author={G.H. Golub and V. Klema and G.W. Stewart},
  title={Rank degeneracy and least squares problems},
  institution={Stanford University}, 
  number={STAN-CS-76-559},
  year=1976
}

Standard reference for (strong) RRQR factorizations, which will hopefully be 
added to Elemental in the near future.
@article{
  author={M. Gu and S. Eisenstat},
  title={Efficient algorithms for computing a strong rank-revealing {QR}
         factorization},
  journal={SIAM J. Sci. Comput},
  volume=17,
  number=4,
  pages={848--869},
  year=1996
}

Singular Value Decomposition
============================

This paper introduced the idea of using a QR decomposition as a first
step in the SVD of a non-square matrix in order to accelerate the 
computation (well, an earlier Golub paper mentioned it as well).

@article{
  author={T.F. Chan},
  title={An improved algorithm for computing the {S}ingular {V}alue
         {D}ecomposition},
  journal={ACM Trans. Math. Soft},
  volume=8,
  number=1,
  pages={72--83},
  year=1982
}

This paper introduced the standard algorithm for computing the SVD.
@article{
  author={G.H. Golub and C. Reinsch},
  title={Singular value decomposition and least squares solutions},
  journal={Numerische Mathematik},
  volume=14,
  number=5,
  pages={403--420},
  year=1970
}

This could serve as a foundation for achieving high absolute accuracy
in a cross-product based algorithm for computing the SVD. Such an
approach should be more scalable than the current 
bidiagonalization-based approach.
@article{
  author={Z. Jia},
  title={Using cross-product matrices to compute the {SVD}},
  journal={Numerical Algorithms},
  volume=42,
  number=1,

  year=2006
}

Symmetric positive-definite inversion
=====================================

The variant 2 single-sweep algorithm from Fig. 9 was parallelized for
Elemental's HPD inversion.

         {P}ositive {D}efinite matrix},
  journal={ACM Trans. Math. Soft},
  volume=35,
  number=1,
  pages={3:1--3:22},
  year=2008
}

Interpolative and skeleton decompositions
=========================================

Standard reference for (pseudo-)skeleton approximations, which are also referred
to as CUR decompositions, especially when the center matrix is non-square.

         matrices},
