Singular Value Decomposition
============================

This paper introduced the idea of using a QR decomposition as a first
step in the SVD of a non-square matrix in order to accelerate the 
computation (well, an earlier Golub paper mentioned it as well).
@article{
  author={Tony F. Chan},
  title={An improved algorithm for computing the {S}ingular {V}alue
         {D}ecomposition},
  journal={ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software},
  volume=8,
  number=1,
  pages={72--83},
  year=1982
}

This paper introduced the standard algorithm for computing the SVD.
@article{

  title={Singular value decomposition and least squares solutions},
  journal={Numerische Mathematik},

  pages={403--420},
  year=1970
}

This could serve as a foundation for achieving high absolute accuracy
in a cross-product based algorithm for computing the SVD. Such an
approach should be more scalable than the current 
bidiagonalization-based approach.
