Relatively trivial but important 
================================
- Unit tests for unaligned DistMatrix redistributions and summations
- Finish adding dot product gemm algorithms for NT, TN, and TT options

Relatively trivial but not important
====================================
- Add local versions of more routines
- Add shortcuts for square process grids and diagonally-aligned matrices

Substantial effort and important
================================
- SVD
- RQ, LQ, and QL factorizations
- Complete parallel Level2 BLAS (e.g., Trmv)

Substantial effort but not terribly important 
=============================================
- Finish adding vector versions of all DistMatrix communications.
- Finish adding redistributions to and from [MD,* ]/[* ,MD]
