Functionality
=============
- Ostrowski matrices
- Power-method-like p-norm estimation (especially when p=2)
- Support for BLIS and fused Trmv's to accelerate HermitianEig
- Transpose option for LeastSquares
- Strong RRQR and RRLQ 
- CUR decompositions (already have (pseudo-)skeleton)
- Complete Orthogonal Decompositions (especially URV)
- Clean up pivoted LU and pivot applications (especially in sequential cases)
- LU with full and rook pivoting
- Pivoted LDL (Bunch-Kaufman and Bunch-Parlett)
- Pivoted Cholesky
- TSQR
- TSLU (via tournament pivoting)
- Lower version of reduction to bidiagonal form
- Reduction to Hessenberg form
- Nonsymmetric (generalized) eigensolver
- Visualization similar to EigTool or Higham's Matrix Computation Toolbox
- Wrappers for more LAPACK eigensolvers
- Sequential versions of Trr2k 
- More explicit expansions of packed Householder reflectors
- More TwoSidedTrmm/TwoSidedTrsm routines
- Compressed pseudoinverse solves which avoid unnecessary backtransformations
- Means of detaching and reattaching the 'viewing' processes for a DistMatrix 
  so collective routines like 'Get' can still be called

Maintenance
===========
- Update elemvariables to support usage of Qt5
- Documentation for new visualization routines (with the Walsh driver as an example)
- Many more references
- Update documentation for new special matrices
- Update documentation for imported routines (and in general)
- References for Interpolative and Skeleton Decomposition 
- Experiment with using scope to avoid SlidePartition
- Document routines added after sequential HermitianEig
- Document HermitianSign and UnitaryCoherence
- Separate out local blas-like and lapack-like operations
- Further improvements for the speed of the build process
- Consistent handling of unblocked routines
- Switch to C++11 for better 64-bit integer and std::complex support, as well as
  std::thread, extern templates, _Pragma, and syntactic sugar
