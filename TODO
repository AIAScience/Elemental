Functionality
=============
- Add probabilistic power-method-based spectral norm estimator
- Add support for BLIS and fused Trmv's
- Add transpose option to LeastSquares
- Clean up pivoted LU and pivot applications (especially in sequential cases)
- Strong RRQR and RRLQ 
- CUR decompositions
- LU with full pivoting
- LU with rook pivoting
- TSQR
- TSLU
- Pivoted LDL
- Lower version of reduction to bidiagonal form
- Reduction to Hessenberg form
- Compressed pseudoinverse solves which avoid unnecessary backtransformations
- Sequential versions of Trr2k 
- Wrappers for more LAPACK eigensolvers
- Nonsymmetric (generalized) eigensolver
- More explicit expansions of packed Householder reflectors
- More TwoSidedTrmm/TwoSidedTrsm routines
- Add means of detaching and reattaching the 'viewing' processes for a 
  DistMatrix so that collective routines like 'Get' can still be called

Maintenance
===========
- Update documentation for new special matrices
- Update documentation for imported routines (and in general)
- Add references for Interpolative and Skeleton Decomposition 
- Experiment with using scope to avoid SlidePartition
- Document routines added after sequential HermitianEig
- Document HermitianSign and UnitaryCoherence
- Separate out local blas-like and lapack-like operations
- Further improvements for the speed of the build process
- Consistent handling of unblocked routines
- Switch to C++11 for better 64-bit integer and std::complex support, as well as
  std::thread, extern templates, and syntactic sugar
