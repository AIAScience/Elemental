Relatively trivial but important 
================================
- Extend Tridiag to complex datatypes.
- Finish adding dot product gemm algorithms for NT, TN, and TT options
- Finish converting syr2k/her2k local updates to recursive approach

Relatively trivial but not important
====================================
- Add shortcuts for square process grids and diagonally-aligned matrices

Substantial effort and important
================================
- Add method for redistributing from one grid to another.
- More LAPACK-level routines!
- Complete parallel Level2 BLAS (e.g., Trmv)

Substantial effort but not terribly important 
=============================================
- Finish adding vector versions of all DistMatrix communications.
- Finish adding redistributions to and from [MD,* ]/[* ,MD] 
- Automate the build process? (preferably not with autoconf)
